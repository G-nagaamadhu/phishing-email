# 🛡 PhishShield AI

An AI-powered phishing email detection system designed to help users identify suspicious emails and prevent cyber fraud.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Phishing attacks are one of the most common cybersecurity threats.  
PhishShield AI uses Machine Learning and pattern-based analysis to detect phishing emails and alert users with a risk score.

This project was developed as part of a hackathon challenge focused on improving digital security awareness.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Users often struggle to differentiate between legitimate emails and phishing attempts.  
This tool analyzes email content and predicts whether it is:

- ✅ Safe  
- ⚠ Phishing  

It also provides a **risk score (%)** to help users understand threat severity.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User pastes email content into the web interface.
2. The backend processes the email using:
   - Text preprocessing
   - TF-IDF Vectorization
   - Machine Learning Model
3. The system returns:
   - Prediction (Safe / Phishing)
   - Risk Score (%)
